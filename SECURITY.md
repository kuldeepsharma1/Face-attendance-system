## Security Best Practices

While using this project, we recommend following these best practices to enhance security:

- **Keep dependencies up to date**: Regularly check for dependencies.
- **Use HTTPS**: Always serve your application over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- **Input validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a strong CSP to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Secure storage**: Safeguard sensitive data by encrypting it at rest and in transit.
